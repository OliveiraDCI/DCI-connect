# DCI Connect

Welcome to our back-end end-of-module project, built in just 9 days during our Web Development course at DCI Digital Career Institute.

DCI is an awesome educational institution, and we are very grateful for the experience of studying there. During our year-log course, Alina put her soft-skills to action and reached out to DCI alumni on LinkedIn to get some advice and feedback about their study journey and path to land that new job. The feedback was very positive, and she had the idea - why not use our skills and create a tool for DCI to connect diferent student generations, and create a stronger community engagement and further suppport current students on achieving their goals?
